### A better solution for bad debt
Rent Relief is, or at least aims to be, a better way for residents to avoid and deal with bad debt. The company was formed 
by myself and 4 other partners all with experience in the property management industry. We had the idea of working on a way to
allow residents to avoid bad debt by working with lenders to provide fair loans to avoid eviction, while also offering a better 
way for residents who would face eviction to pay their outstanding debt.

#### Try, Fail, Try Again
After a series of complications with vendor relationships and a demanding development schedule Rent Relief has been sitting on 
the bench awaiting completion. But throughout the experience I gained a close familiarity with the property management industry
and a few close friends along the way.
