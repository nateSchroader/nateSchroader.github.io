Vendor Verify is a online compliance utility. The company helps vendors working for property management companies to upload 
and maintain their compliance documentation.

In mid 2015 Vendor Verify was in some serious trouble. The latest version of their custom software was littered with bad 
and missing data, incomplete sections and broken functionally. After working closely with their staff to get the site back 
in a a workable condition we started looking towards the future of the company and it's software.

By working closely with their staff I began to really understand the day to day needs of the every user of the site. I'm quite proud of the result.
