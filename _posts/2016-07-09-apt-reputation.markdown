### Reputation is the new currency
APT Reputation is a online reputation monitoring and management service specifically made for the property management community.

#### Software Reborn
In early March 2016, I was chatting with a friend over a project he had commissioned overseas. After a quick look through the 
code I could tell he was in major trouble. The product was a maze of different frameworks mashed on top of one another while
completely ignoring some of the more critical security features found in each one. For teh sake of the company, it had to be remade.
 
In a blur of caffeine and late night coding we remade the site into a stronger product no longer reliant on 3rd party services. 
With the help of our good friends at Western Reporting we made our debut in the early summer of 2016 at the 
[National Apartment Association Conference](http://educonf.naahq.org/) in San Fransisco.
